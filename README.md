# Coffee-Shop-Sales-with-SQL
I created a custom database using MySQL then created a dashboard with Tableau.
### Step-1
I used some random data generators to create the data. Because of that, results of the final data might not be realistic as a real coffee shop sales.
### Step-2
After I created the raw data, I imported the tables to my empty SQL tables.
### Step-3
Then I queried the raw data for my dashboard.
### Step-4
I use the free version of tableau so I couldn't import the data directly from MySQL. Because of that, I exported the query as csv file and uploaded it to tableau.
### Step-5
I created the dashboard.
