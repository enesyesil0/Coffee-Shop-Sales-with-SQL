# Coffee-Shop-Sales-with-SQL
I created a custom database using MySQL then created a dashboard with Tableau.
[Check out the dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/CoffeeShopSalesDashboard_17038852619130/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
## Step-1
I used some random data generators to create the data. Because of that, results of the final data might not be realistic as a real coffee shop sales.
## Step-2
I created the tables in SQL.
## Step-3
After I created the raw data, I imported the tables to my empty SQL tables.
## Step-4
Then I queried the raw data for my dashboard.
## Step-5
I use the free version of tableau so I couldn't import the data directly from MySQL. Because of that, I exported the query as csv file and uploaded it to tableau.
## Step-6
I created the dashboard.
